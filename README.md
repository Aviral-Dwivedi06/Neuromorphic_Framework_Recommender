# NeuroMRecommender
## Neuromorphic System Recommender

**Developed by Team Morpheus for the Micron Mimory Competition**

## Project Overview

The **Neuromorphic System Recommender** is a hardware design assistant that bridges the gap between high-level application requirements and low-level circuit architectures. By leveraging Machine Learning (Random Forest) and a Rule-Based Engineering Logic layer, this tool recommends optimal neuron models, device types (CMOS vs. RRAM), and architectural configurations based on specific technology nodes and power budgets.

This project was specifically designed to explore memory centric neuromorphic computing, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck through architectural recommendations inspired by 3D-stacked memory (HMC) and memristive crossbars.

## Key Features

* **ML-Driven Recommendations:** Uses a Multi-Output Random Forest model trained on neuromorphic research (Neurocube, LSMCore, etc.).
* **Rationale Intelligence:** A hybrid logic layer that flags physical design risks, such as static leakage in advanced nodes (e.g., 28nm) for ultra-low power applications.
* **Memory-Centric Focus:** Recommends architectures like 3D HMC + 2D Mesh for high-bandwidth tasks, aligning with Micron’s vision for high-density memory integration.
* **Interactive Design:** A command-line interface allowing users test various scenarios.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates a comparative analysis chart of different design sessions to visualize power vs. technology scaling.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* VS Code (recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the project** to your local machine.
2. **Open the terminal** in VS Code and create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv

```


3. **Activate the environment**:
* Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
* Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`


4. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## How to Use

1. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py

```


2. **Enter your constraints** when prompted:
* **Process Node:** e.g., `15`, `45`, or `180` (nm)
* **Power Budget:** e.g., `500` (High Perf) or `0.0001` (Ultra-low)
* **Application:** Choose from the provided list (e.g., `High-Perf CNN`).


3. **Analyze Results:** View the recommended Neuron model and Architecture. Look for warnings generated by the Rationale Intelligence layer.
4. **Visualize:** Type `exit` to close the session and automatically generate the comparison graph.

## Model Logic & Dataset

The model is trained on data points derived from several seminal papers, including:

* *Neurocube: A Programmable Digital Neuromorphic Architecture with High-Density 3D Memory*
* *LSMCore: A 69k-Synapse/mm² Single-Core Digital Neuromorphic Processor*
* *Memory-Centric Neuromorphic Computing for Unstructured Data Processing*

### Design Rules

The system includes built-in logic to assist designers:

* **Leakage Warning:** Triggers if `Power < 100nW` and `Node < 40nm`.
* **Precision Note:** Flags potential error-correction needs for Memristive RRAM in CNN applications.
